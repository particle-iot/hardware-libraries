Particle Devices Eagle Library
====================================

In this library you'll find representation of Particle devices for use
in CAD software.

- [Footprints to make circuit boards in Eagle](https://github.com/spark/hardware-libraries/tree/master/Eagle)
- [Parts to make breadboard diagrams in Fritzing](https://github.com/spark/hardware-libraries/tree/master/Fritzing)

There are for reference and you may need to adjust them for your application. See the documentation for more details on the recommended PCB foot prints.
